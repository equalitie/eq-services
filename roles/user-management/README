This role is user to manage users in cityhall.

It is not meant for users that we provision on
servers, but like for email users, etc.


The way you use this is create a file named
config/users/inventory_hostname.yml formated
like this:


---
users_list:
  - user: test1
    name: 'Test User'
    active: true
    shell: '/bin/sh'
    comment: 'This is a test user'
    create_home: true
    home: '/home/test1'
    groups:
      - sudo
  - user: test2
    name: 'Test2 User'
    active: true
    shell: '/bin/false'
    create_home: true
    home: '/home/test2'
    comment: 'This is a test user 2'
    groups:
      - sudo
      - sys
  - user: test3
    name: 'Test3 User'
    active: true
    shell: '/bin/false'
    create_home: false
    comment: 'This is a test user 3'
    groups:
      - sudo

Note: A user without a home directory will
not get a password set and will basically
be locked without a password.

You can make "active: false". This will not
delete the user but will lock this user. To
delete a user you must add both "active: false"
and "delete: true"

When a user is first created it will store the
user,{passwd or password pusher url if passswd pusher is used}

To enable password pusher you will need to set
pwpusher: true
pwpusher_url: "https://your.passwordpusher.tld/pw.php"

When a password gets set a file in the users home directory
named ".password_set" will be written. If you need a password
reset, just remove this file and run the playbook again.

A "users" tag is setup so that you can run

ansible-playbook site.yml --tags=users
